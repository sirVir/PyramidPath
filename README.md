# PyramidPath
Finds the maximum Path in the pyramid.
Storage complexity: O(n)
Computational complexity: O(n)

Computational complexity is optimal (best possible) because any algorithm would need to process the full input to find a path.

# Sample output
Max sum: 7260
Path: 215->192->117->218->805->728->277->528->863->632->931->778->413->310->253
